        <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this review i'll be looking at the
          HP Spectre x360, a powerhouse of a laptop with great aesthetics and an impressive display.
          So does it perform as well as it looks? Lets find out.

        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Good</h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of good things that this laptop has to offer. To start with the
          specs of the product are impressive for a laptop, packing a seventh generation
           Intel Core i7 and an nVidia GTX 940MX it will handle all office tasks with
           ease and even handle light gaming if you ever want to relax after work or studying.
           The Spectre x360 also comes with 8GB of RAM allowing for more than enough memory
           for office tasks and even light editing tasks. Storage on the Spectre is no slouch
           either with, depending on the model, 256GB-1TB of PCIe SSD storage rated at transfer
           speeds of over 1GB/s. The input devices on the Spectre are great too, the keyboard
           is easy to use with a short travel and it overall performs well and feels somewhat
           familiar, the trackpad is large and makes for a good browsing experience using it.
           The mouse doesn't get knocked when you accidentally touch it with the palm of your
           hand and even has a satisfying tactile click when selecting things.
           Another impressive feature is the IPS 4K display, text is crisp, viewing angles are
           immense. It is hard to move back to a lower resolution screen after working on this
           laptop for a while.
        <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Technical specs are amazing for a small form factor laptop.</li>
          <li>Keyboard and trackpad are very well designed and feel excellent to use.</li>
          <li>The display is crisp and has amazing viewing angles.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Bad</h3>
        <p>
          The first major put off for most people is going to be the price of this laptop
          it is a premium product and as such it is priced as one. Selling for £1,299.00 for
          the base model and £1.899.00 for the top of the line model, this laptop does not come
          cheap at all. Another issue is that whilst the touch screen and pen can be useful it
          is very niche and probably won't see much use in every day use, but if you do need it
          it is there and available to be used. The laptop can also be folded in half and be used
          in tablet mode which honestly feels like a useless feature, some might find this to be
          useful but at the time of writing this review I honestly can say that, outside of testing
          it, I have never used the tablet mode. Something else that is a more of an annoyance is the
          hinges on the Spectre they feel solid, but the slighest knock or jolt or even pressing hard
          on the keyboard can make the screen have a slight wobble.
        <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The Spectre is very expensive.</li>
          <li>Touchscreen and pen functionality feels redundant.</li>
          <li>The tablet mode feels like a useless feature.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          So do the positives outweight the negatives? In my opinion yes they do. The tech
          specs are amazing for a small laptop. It has plenty of storage and enough memory
          to get the job done for light editing and all office tasks and is a powerhouse of
          a laptop and is well worth the asking price.
