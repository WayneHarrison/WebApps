        <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Logitech G502 a middle of the pack mouse, but is that all there is to it?
          Find out more in the review below.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Good</h3>
        <p>
          The G502 is an exceptional mouse offering many high end features that make it
          very good value for money. One of these features includes an optical sensor
          allowing for up to 12,000 dpi if you wish. The sensor is highly accurate and
          feels very responsive to use, and the Logitech Gaming Software suite allows you
          to tune the sensor specifically to the surface that you are using to further
          increase the accuracy of the sensor. Another useful feature that the G502 has
          is that it is very comfortable to use because of its design, providing a large
          body for you to grip and very well designed button placements that are easy to
          access no matter the grip that you prefer to use. And finally the price of the G502
          is low for the quality that is offered, retailing at around Â£50 making it available to
          people on a budget and also people that are looking for a high quality mouse that doesn't
          break the bank.
          <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>High quality sensor with up to 12,000 DPI.</li>
          <li>Ergonomic, easy to access buttons and feels good to use.</li>
          <li>Cheap, very high build quality for the price.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Bad</h3>
        <p>
          The G502 is a very large mouse, meaning that some people with smaller hands might have
          issues accessing some of the buttons, such as the sniper button, as they are placed
          towards the edge of the mouse. Another issue is that the G502 will probably not appeal
          to the average consumer, it being pushed towards people that are gamers instead of
          people that are working within an office environment.
          <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The sniper button is placed poorly.</li>
          <li>Doesn't appeal to the average consumer pushed towards gamers.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          So, is the G502 worth your money? In my opinion yes it is. The ergonomics are great
          and it very cheap for the features on offer.
