        <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Logitech G810 Orion a keyboard with a high price point, but is it worth it?
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Good</h3>
        <p>
          Some useful features that the G810 offers is all of the multimedia keys, they are
          very hard to go without when you move to a keyboard without them. The switches within
          the keyboard are also a nice touch, whilst odd at first they really start to grow on
          you within a few hours of use, the spacing between the keys is good too and mispresses
          were rare even when in use for long periods of times. There is also RGB if you're into
          that kind of thing.
          <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Multimedia keys are useful and are missed when without them.</li>
          <li>The switches in the keys are nice to use.</li>
          <li>RGB is available if you want to use it.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">The Bad</h3>
        <p>
          The G810 does not come cheap unfortunately, retailing at Â£150 it is priced high compared to
          some other alternatives and competitors. However unlike other Logitech keyboards one feature is
          missing which are the macro keys commonly found on sometimes cheaper keyboards.
          <h4 class="title">TL;DR</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Sits within an expensive price range.</li>
          <li>Missing some features such as G-Keys.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Would I reccomend this keyboard to you? I'd say no. Whilst the features that it has are useful
          the price when compared to similar keyboards at a cheaper price point it does lack some features
          the cheaper keyboards have.
